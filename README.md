The project provides methods for end-to-end data integration. The framework implements well-known methods for data pre-processing, schema matching, identity resolution, data fusion, and result evaluation. The methods are designed to be easily customizable by exchanging pre-defined building blocks, such as blockers, matching rules, similarity functions, and conflict resolution functions. In addition, these pre-defined building blocks can be used as foundation for implementing advanced integration methods.
